I'm temporarily continuing to use the `ereshkigal` based deployment for `archimedes` to get it's
network stack fixed. Maybe that has something to do with the weird ssh connection dropping I've been
getting on `toto`, not really sure what else it could be.

Alternately, it may be DHCP interferance on ifrit, so I might turn off DHCP again to see if that
helps.
